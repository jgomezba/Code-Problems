## 01_Islands.py
Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

## 02_best_path_in_matrix.py
Given a matrix of indefinite dimension, take the best reward on it by moving only down or right

## 03_pi_estimation_monte_carlo.py
The Monte Carlo estimation of π using a circle of radius 1 is a probabilistic technique that relies on random simulation to approximate the value of π.<br>
